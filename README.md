# BLOCKS
A lightweight command-line tool for rendering predefined shapes with hashtags. Just pick a shape, set its size, and see it drawn in your terminal.


## Scaling
Each shape supports scaling, either uniformly or, for certain shapes, with independent control over width and height.

## Shapes
  - rectangle
  - triangle
  - diamond
  - parallelogram
  - trapezoid
  - tree

## Roadmap
New shapes will likely be introduced in the near future, depending heavily on available time and interest.
